# Changelog

All notable changes to the **FlexColorPicker** package will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.1] - April 10, 2021
* **New feature:** Enabled updating the color picker externally. Just set the `color` property of the widget to a 
  new value to update it and even "remote control" it, if so needed.  
  
  This is mostly a potential use-case for desktop/web when the picker is not used in a dialog. 
  You can of course can do this on a phone or tablet too, but often there is not room enough to use the picker 
  this way on mobile devices. 
  However, on desktops it is certainly a valid use case that should be supported. It was previously enabled,
  but as we are going for full inclusion of web/desktop use-cases, it should certainly be supported.
  This update adds support for it. The picker only updates if the externally provided
  `color` constructor property differs from its internally kept color state. Finding the right picker, computing 
  the swatches, is a bit demanding, but it seems to work fluidly, even when remote controlling the wheel and sliders
  interactively, at least on desktop and web builds.

* **Web example**: Updated the Web example to also show the "remote control" of the on-screen color picker. A
  remote control widget with a few color boxes, that you can click on to update its colors externally was added. 
  The demo even goes meta, and you can use a modal dialog version of the ColorPicker, to control the ColorPicker 
  on the screen in the card, from the dialog ColorPicker! Maybe not as such so useful, but an interesting demo.
  
## [2.0.0] - April 9, 2021
* This release only contains documentation updates from pre-release **2.0.0-nullsafety.5**
* Thi is the first stable release of the null-safe version
* This is a **MAJOR** new feature release, in addition to the null-safety conversion.   
  Please see changelogs from 2.0.0-nullsafety.0 to nullsafety.5, for a complete list of changes and new features.
* To get familiar with version 2.0.0 and all its new features, it is recommended to go through the updated tutorial,
  and the API guide in the readme file. 
* For convenience, the list of breaking changes from last stable version 1.1.5 are listed below.
  
  ### Breaking Changes
  In addition to breaking changes as a result of the null-safety implementation, this release contain a few other
  **minor breaking changes** from version 1.x, they mostly concern visual nuances and label defaults.


* The `colorCodeIcon` has been deprecated and no longer has any function. To modify the copy icon on the color
  code entry field, define the `ColorPickerCopyPasteBehavior(copyIcon: myIcon)` and provide it to the
  `copyPasteBehavior` property, it defaults to same icon as in versions 1.x.
* The bottom dialog action button that selects the color now says **OK** instead of **Select**. The label for the OK
  button by default comes from a Material localization. You can as before change it to whatever string you want.
* The dialog bottom action button for **OK** by default now uses a plain `TextButton` and
  not an `OutlinedButton`. This change is done to conform to a less opinionated default style. You can still
  manually configure it to use an `OutlinedButton` instead as before. Now you can choose, before there was
  no choice.
* The dialog bottom **OK** button is no longer auto-focused.
* The extension `FlexPickerNoNullStringExtensions` on none nullable
  `String` named `toColor`, no longer returns color value `Color(0x00000000)` for colors that cannot be parsed
  to a Color. It now returns `Color(0xFF000000)`. This is because the Flutter SDK dislikes the fully transparent
  black `Color(0x00000000)`, if it is full opaque black, it works better as a fallback safety color.
  The `FlexPickerNullableStringExtensions` on `String?` named `toColorMaybeNull` works as before by returning
  null when the `String?` cannot be parsed to a `Color`.
* The color code edit and entry field now works more like a normal text entry field. It still
  only accepts valid hex input and converts all input to uppercase.

## [2.0.0-nullsafety.5] - April 8, 2021
* **Fix:** Setting `borderColor` did not change the border color on the wheel when `wheelHasBorder` was true. 
* **New features:** The `showPickerDialog` method now exposes most (= not directly controlled) properties 
  of the underlying `AlertDialog` used to make the dialog, this includes e.g. the `backgroundColor`, `elevation`,
  `clipBehavior` and `shape` as new exposed properties that may be useful.
* **New feature:** Added a new alternative color picker dialog function `showColorPickerDialog` that returns a
  `Future<Color>` which when the dialog is closed, returns the selected color from the dialog or original start 
  color value, if no selection was made.
  This picker might be simpler to use in some scenarios, but it does not allow
  for the feature where colors and theme's can update in the background behind the dialog, as colors are selected
  in it, before it is even closed. However, if you just need to open a dialog, select a color and move on, this
  version offers a simpler API for that. Under the hood it is just a wrapper for the previous more 
  capable version with the onChange callbacks. It shares all other properties and features with the `ColorPicker`
  combined with its `showPickerDialog` method, except all the **onChanged** callbacks that are excluded.  
  Since the properties `elevation` and `title` in the `showPickerDialog` method, would collide with the same
  named properties in `ColorPicker`. The dialog's elevation and title in the `showColorPickerDialog` are  
  instead called `dailogElevation` and `dialogTitle` in it.
* **Improvement:** Performance was improved via more optimized rebuilds.   
* **Documentation:** First version of updated documentation with API guide documentation is now included. It still 
  requires proof-reading before stable release, but getting close to be ready for release now.
* **Default example:** The default example got a new picker that shows how to the new `showColorPickerDialog` function.
* **Web example:** The Web example, with the built-in API tooltips guides, got a major rewrite. It was originally
  not intended to be as large as it grew to be, but since it grew so much it needed a rewrite.   
  It now uses Riverpod to make its simple state management needs easy to handle and much cleaner than before.
  It also includes persisting the settings directly as settings are changed in the app. The persistence is 
  implemented with Hive and should work on all Flutter platforms as well, but it has only been tested on Android, 
  Web and Windows.   
  As an experiment, only RiverPod StateProviders were used. While the setup is a bit tedious, it enables the desired 
  fine-grained control over rebuilds of all the used setting control widgets. Each setting is also stored as an 
  individual key-value pair in the used Hive box.  
  A ProviderObserver that observes changes in the StateProviders we want to persist, is used to save any state change 
  to the used Hive box, regardless of where the state is changed in the demo app. This setup was an experiment to 
  see if it might work and provide some simplification benefits. At least in this case it did, and it is also a pretty
  interesting and simple solution.  
  The default start values are also defined via the Riverpod StateProvider's default values, that also 
  use their const Hive string key as their provider name. Each StateProvider gets its start setting value from 
  the Hive box with the same key. If the key does not exist yet in Hive, it falls back to a default value from a
  const Map using the same string const as its key, for the default fallback value. Reset back to default values is 
  also done by setting all providers' state back to their default values as defined by the same const 
  fallback value map.

## [2.0.0-nullsafety.4] - March 22, 2021
* **New feature:** A bool `enableOpacity` property was added that enables an opacity 
  slider that can be used to control the alpha channel in the selected ARGB color value. The slider 
  height can be controlled with `opacityTrackHeight`, the width with `opacityTrackWidth` and the 
  slider thumb size with `opacityThumbRadius`. There is also a `opacitySubheading` Widget that can 
  be used to provide a Widget heading for the opacity slider. 
  
## [2.0.0-nullsafety.3] - March 12, 2021
* **Fix:** Color code field no longer receives focus when switching to it on wheel page.
  Focus is set to color wheel, or the selected color shade, if the
  shade colors are present. The focus handling has also been improved for desktop usage.
* **Fix:** The property `editUsesParsedPaste` now works as intended, if true, desktop keyboard paste commands, 
  while editing a color value are intercepted, and the hole pasted buffer value gets parsed, it does not get 
  pasted into the field. For normal field paste functionality keep `editUsesParsedPaste` false (default). 
* **Minor breaking:** The color code edit and entry field now works more like a normal text entry field. It still 
  only accepts valid hex input and converts all input to uppercase.
* **New property:** If `colorCodeHasColor` is true, then the background of the color code entry field uses the current
  selected color.  
* **New property** If `colorCodeReadOnly` the color code entry field is always read only. Normally color code can 
  be edited on the wheel picker, set this to true to make it read only there as well. Copy/paste operations still work
  if they are enabled even if the color code field entry is in read only mode.
* **New feature:** The `copyPasteBehavior` property received three new features and properties: 
   * The copy/paste context menu can now also optionally use secondary, typically mouse right, click by setting
     `secondaryMenu` to true. 
   *  It also has a mode where long press will be used on iOS/Android, but secondary mouse click will be
      used on desktop/web, by setting `secondaryOnDesktopLongOnDevice` to true.
   *  When `parseShortHexCode` is true the hex color code paste action and field entry parser,
      interpret short three character web hex color codes like in CSS.     
* **New extension:** The extension `FlexPickerNoNullStringExtensions` on `String` got a new 
  extension function `Color toColorShort(bool enableShortRGB)`.     
* **New extension:** The extension `FlexPickerNullableStringExtensions` on `String?` got a new
  extension function `Color? toColorShortMaybeNull(bool enableShortRGB)`.
* **Minor breaking:** The extension `FlexPickerNoNullStringExtensions` on none nullable 
  `String` named `toColor`, no longer returns color value `Color(0x00000000)` for colors that cannot be parsed
  to a Color. It now returns `Color(0xFF000000)`. This is because the Flutter SDK dislikes the fully transparent 
  black `Color(0x00000000)`, if it is full opaque black, it works better as a fallback safety color. 
  The `FlexPickerNullableStringExtensions` on `String?` named `toColorMaybeNull` works as before by returning
  null when the `String?` cannot be parsed to a `Color`. 
* **Tests:** Added unit tests for `ColorPickerActionButtonType` and `ColorPickerCopyPasteBehavior`.  

*See API documentation for more information.*

## [2.0.0-nullsafety.2] - March 3, 2021
* Documentation and live Web demo link fixes.

## [2.0.0-nullsafety.1] - March 3, 2021
There are many new features included in this version 2 pre-release. The new features can be explored with 
[live Web example](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorpicker/). Its source code is also included in the package 
example folder, in "example/lib/demo/main.dart".

* **Improvement:** The wheel picker now move on pointer down to point location, it no longer requires a slight movement
  for its thumbs to move to the selected start tracking point.
* **Improvements:** Keyboard traversal of the colors and selecting indicator colors with the keyboard via
  enter or space. The wheel can however still not be operated with a keyboard, only touch and mouse controlled. 
* **New property:** `onColorChangeStart` called when user starts color selection with current color before the change.
* **New property:** `onColorChangeEnd` called when user ends color selection with the new color value. 
* **New property:** `selectedPickerTypeColor` the color of the thumb on the slider that shows the selected picker.
  Ported from none null-safe version 1.1.4, does not exist in version 2.0.0-nullsafety.0.
* **New property:** `colorCodePrefixStyle` defines the text style of the prefix for the color code.
  If not defined it defaults to same style as `colorCodeTextStyle`.
  Ported from none null-safe version 1.1.4, does not exist in version 2.0.0-nullsafety.0.
* **New property:** `title` is a Widget used as an app bar type of title widget above the heading. Can also
  include copy, paste, select-close and cancel-cancel icon buttons when picker is used as a dialog.
* **New feature:** There is an `actionButtons` property that takes an `ColorPickerActionButtons()`. It is used to
  define what type of **Ok** and **Cancel** action buttons the color picker has when used in a dialog. 
  It is possible to define if bottom action buttons should be `TextButton`, `OutlinedButton` or `ElevatedButton` 
  per button. If not defined, the labels on the buttons come from Material localizations, not from default hard 
  coded values. See breaking label for the 'Select' label. There are optional select/OK and cancel icon buttons 
  that can be used in the title bar for a more compact dialog. 
* **New feature**: There is a `copyPasteBehavior` property that takes an `ColorPickerCopyPasteBehavior()`. 
  It is used to define the copy/paste behavior of the color picker, including: 
    * Keyboard shortcuts: CTRL-C, CMD-C, CTRL-V, CMD-V
    * Top toolbar copy-paste buttons.
    * Long press copy-paste menu. 
  
  All copy/paste behaviors are optional and can be enabled based on what is needed.
  
  For the copy format, the desired resulting RGB color string format can be configured to use #RRGGBB 
  RRGGBB #AARRGGBB AARRGGBB and 0xAARRGGBB (default) options. The selected copy format is indicated with the 
  corresponding prefix in the color code display/edit field when it is enabled.

  Paste supports parsing multiple RGB color string formats. It automatically detects what format is used and auto
  parses to correct Flutter/Dart color value. You can e.g. paste string formatted as #RRGGBB RRGGBB #AARRGGBB
  AARRGGBB #RGB RGB or 0xAARRGGBB, partial color string values also work. You can also activate
  a snack bar that informs the users if they paste color strings in an unsupported RGB string format into the
  color picker.

  *See API documentation for more information.*

* **New feature**: The picker can display recently used colors in a list of color indicators at the bottom of 
  the picker. You can use the following properties to control it.
    * `showRecentColors`: Set to true/false to enable/disable the usage of the recent colors feature.
    * `recentColorsSubheading`: Subheading widget for the recently used colors. Typically, a Text widget, 
      e.g. Text('Recent colors'). If not provided there is no sub heading for the recently used colors.
    * `maxRecentColors`: Number of recent colors to track, from 2 to 20 allowed.
    * `recentColors`: a list with current recent color, defaults to empty. You can store the last list
      and use this list to restore the previous recent colors list.
    * `onRecentColorsChanged`: Optional value callback that returns a copy the current list of recently 
      used colors. Use it store a copy of the recent colors in order to be able to restore it later.
      
 *See API documentation for more information.*

### Breaking changes
The following are **minor breaking changes** from version 1.1.5, they mostly concern visual nuances and label defaults.
* The `colorCodeIcon` has been deprecated and no longer has any function. To modify the copy icon on the color 
  code entry field, define the `ColorPickerCopyPasteBehavior(copyIcon: myIcon)` and provide it to the
  `copyPasteBehavior` property, it defaults to same icon as in version 1.1.5. 
* The bottom dialog action button that selects the color now says **OK** instead of **Select**. The label for the OK 
  button by default comes from a Material localization. You can as before change it to whatever string you want.
* The dialog bottom action button for **OK** by default now uses just a plain `TextButton` and 
  not an `OutlinedButton`, this change is done to conform to a less opinionated default style. You can still
  manually configure it to use an `OutlinedButton` instead as before. Now you can choose, before there was 
  no choice.
* The dialog bottom **OK** button is no longer auto-focused. 
  
## [2.0.0-nullsafety.0] - February 15, 2021
* First version with null safety.
* A workaround to issue [#71687](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71687) was introduced. 
  The issue has not been solved. However, the workaround allows for the Wrap implementation that was 
  changed to a Row in version 1.1.2, to be used again.
* The almost full API configurable Web example and demo, was included in the package in 
  "example/lib/demo/main.dart" together with the previous default example in "example/lib/main.dart". 
  Previously this Web example was in a separate GitHub repository. The example was updated to make it 
  responsive, to offer better usability on Web.

## [1.1.5] - March 3, 2021
* **Fix:** When `selectedPickerTypeColor` color was undefined, the thumb did not receive the same text color as the
  default and only one before in version 1.1.3 and earlier, in dark-mode. This broke compatibility with past style
  when using dark-mode. This fix restores the correct past style when the `selectedPickerTypeColor` is undefined.
  
## [1.1.4] - March 3, 2021
* **Feature:** New property `selectedPickerTypeColor`: Defines the color of the thumb on the slider that shows the selected picker.
* **Feature:** New property `colorCodePrefixStyle`: Defines the text style of the prefix for the color code.
  If not defined it defaults to same style as `colorCodeTextStyle`.
  
## [1.1.3] - December 22, 2020
* **Fix:** Faulty documentation and comment for showPickerDialog parameter insetPadding.
* **Fix:** Faulty default value for showPickerDialog parameter insetPadding, the new default
  value is the same as Flutter and Material default
  `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 40.0, vertical: 24.0)`, as it should have been.
* **Documentation:** Minor documentation style correction.

## [1.1.2] - December 5, 2020
* Temporary: The Wrap implementation for showing the color code and integer value was changed to a Row due to a regression in Flutter SDK causing a crash issue on channels dev and master when showing the ColorPicker in a Dialog. For more info see here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/71687
When the issue is resolved, the implementation will be reverted to Wrap again. Using a Wrap has the added benefit of breaking the color code display+input field, and the rarely used int value, into two rows in case a large font is used in a narrow view when they are both configured to be shown. The Row may overflow in some rare cases. If you do not plan to use the ColorPicker with channels and versions affected by the issue, you can still use the previous version 1.1.1 to keep using the Wrap implementation if you need it. With normal styling it is typically not needed.
* Fixed that the provided `TextStyle` via property `colorCodeTextStyle` was not also applied to the shown color integer value when `showColorValue` was set to `true`, as stated in API doc and intended.

## [1.1.1] - November 11, 2020
* Updated the example app and documentation. The update includes updated screenshots and updated animated gifs.
* Unit tests for ColorTools added, widget tests still pending for later updates.

## [1.1.0] - November 6, 2020
* New API: Added `showColorValue` to optionally display the int value of the selected color. This can be used to assist developers when they need to see or copy selected color values as int numbers.
* New APIs: Exposed previously missing static color names in the API for all the accent and B&W color names in `ColorTools`. All the color name values default to English color names, but can now be changed to translated strings to provide Material color names in other languages as well.
* Updated the live Web demo to demonstrate the `showColorValue` property.
* Example and documentation updated.

## [1.0.0] - November 5, 2020
* First official release.
* Example and documentation updated.
* Updated the live Web demo version to use the released package.
* New API: Added `shouldUpdate` to the color wheel picker, as a fix for an issue where black selection changed hue to red. This is a lower level API that is not needed unless you make your own picker from scratch, and you want to use the wheel picker in your own picker.
* Final API name tweaks before version 1.0.0 release:
* Renamed: API `createPrimaryColor` -> `createPrimarySwatch`
* Renamed: API `createAccentColor` -> `createAccentSwatch`
* Renamed: API `colorNameAndHexCode` -> `materialNameAndCode`
* Renamed: API `colorName` -> `materialName`
* Renamed: API `colorHexCode` -> `colorCode`

## [1.0.0-dev.5] - November 5, 2020
* Added a feature on the wheel color picker that enables entry of a hex RGB value to select a color.
* API changes to support separate display of Material color name `showMaterialName` and selected color code `showColorCode`, plus defining their text styles `materialNameTextStyle` and `colorCodeTextStyle`.
* New API `showColorName` to display an English color name for any selected color, not just the Material color names or custom named color swatches. It has text style that can be defined as well `colorNameTextStyle`.
* New API `colorCodeIcon` that exposes the color code copy icon, so it can be customized.
* New API `enableTooltips` to enable current and future tooltips used in the picker. Currently, only the copy color code button has a tooltip.
* A new method introduced in ColorTools called `nameThatColor(Color color)`. It returns a name for any color passed to it. Only supports English names. Based on a Dart port of http://chir.ag/projects/ntc, it contains 1566 colors and their names. It matches the given color to the closest similar color in the list and returns its name.
* Example and documentation updated.

## [1.0.0-dev.4] - November 2, 2020
* Update to try to get the images to show up on pub.dev.
* Minor documentation corrections.

## [1.0.0-dev.3] - November 2, 2020
* Significant API name changes and cleanup. Decided to implement previously planned changes before the official release, even if it will also impact our own usage of the package when we move to using the published version.

## [1.0.0-dev.2] - October 30, 2020
* First development pre-release on pub.dev.
