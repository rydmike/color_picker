# This GitHub actions runs on a release, when it is published, created or edited.
#  - Installs Dart and flutter
#  - Uses Flutter beta channel for now.
#  - Enables Flutter web
#  - Gets package dependencies
#  - Runs dart analyze, allows deprecation warnings, we on purpose allow use of deprecated features on beta channel,
#    as they might not yet be deprecated on stable and we will keep using some of the features that are deprecated
#    as long as they are not also deprecated on stable.
#  - Show outdated packages, just added for info.
#  - Verify that dart format is used by all committed code, fails if not. Controversial but pub.dev penalizes you if
#    dart format is not used.
#  - Run all tests with coverage.
#  - Upload code coverage output to Codecov for analysis.
#  - Install linux rpl tool. It is used to automate the needed change of a line in index.html.
#  - Build the WEB demo app for FlexColorPicker.
#    - Flutter clean.
#    - Flutter build web app, in release mode and with CanvasKit renderer.
#    - Use rpl to fix/modify the index.html file to give it the correct href deployment sub-folder.
#    - Deploy the Web example to GitHub pages.

# Edit and add other trigger options if an extra new Web deployment is needed.
# Generally I only need a new deployment when I publish a new release, but I may want to trigger it on defaults:
# prerelease or just an edit sometimes to test the workflow or a new build irl, these trigger types can be used then:
#    types: [published, created, edited, prereleased]
